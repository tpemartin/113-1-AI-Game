# Class Setup

  * AI assistants: ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Google's Gemini 
  * Game playing environment: Google Sheets. 
  * Computation environment: Google Colab. (AI assistants based on language models might not be able to validate the response results. Need other computation environment to validate the results.)
