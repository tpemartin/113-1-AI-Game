# Strategic thinking with AI

## Gaol

In each game, we start from a human description (non-abstract) describing the game. The goal is to design a chatbot that can make us clear about the game rules, strategies, and payoffs.

  - Use AI to enhance strategic thinking

## Play with AI 

Play with AI with the given game setup.   
  - Ask him why he made a certain move.  
  - Ask him what move should I make next. And ask him to explain why.

## Strategic Thinking prompt

When I ask you what strategy I should use in a game, instead of giving me a direct answer, can you create a dialogue to guide me to think strategically?

## Learning Prompt

If I describe a game to you in natural language, can you design a chatbot that can simulate the game?
